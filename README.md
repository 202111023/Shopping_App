```
- **For Seller account**

```
  - Email: admin@test
  - Pass: admin
```

On visiting the link given above, a user will have the options to signup or login
A user can signup as a **Buyer** or a **Seller**

A seller account has access to a **Seller Dashboard** which gives business insights to the
seller to make informed decisions about their business.

The **Seller Dashboard** utilizes SQL queries to get realtime data
I added this feature because of my interest in Business Intelligence.
**I wanted to include the feature for these reasons**
- provides realtime insights and trends to sellers
- Solves a real world problem as it focuses on using data to make decisions and improve sales and target the ideal audience
- Simple data like user locations and repeated sales helps draw valueable conclusions

I wanted to make use of the user's data collected by the Web App and use it to it's full potential.
The Dashboard utilizes backend APIs to transfer data from the database to only draw conclusions and yet
keep user data safe and secure.
I wanted to do something useful with my data interpretation and analysis skills, and adding this feature
and the problems that I faced, helped me polish my data handling and backend skills, while helping me
learn a lot more.

## Improvements/Future Updates
At the time of creating this web app, I was learning react and wanted to apply my knowledge of React, SQL, git
and other technologies to create a full fledged application that is dynamic.
I also had created many web apps before but had never deployed an app live, that was not static and allowed remote 
access to user from anywhere. And hence this project was a way for me to learn all of it.
Making a whole project by myself at this scale for the first time was sure difficult and tiring but also interesting 
and helped me polish my skills.

I need to work on improving the following aspects of the app
- User Interface and Design of website
- Form Validation
- Payment gateway integration
- Adding Visualizations to the Seller Dashboard

Thanks for showing interest and taking the time to explore my project. If you have any questions, feedback or suggestions please
