## Improvements/Future Updates
At the time of creating this web app, I was learning react and wanted to apply my knowledge of React, SQL, git
and other technologies to create a full fledged application that is dynamic.
I also had created many web apps before but had never deployed an app live, that was not static and allowed remote 
access to user from anywhere. And hence this project was a way for me to learn all of it.
Making a whole project by myself at this scale for the first time was sure difficult and tiring but also interesting 
and helped me polish my skills.

I am aware about the drawbacks like that I need to work on
- Poor User Interface
- visually unappealing
- Lacks form validation
- Payment gateway not integrated

Thanks for showing interest and taking the time to explore my project. If you have any questions, feedback or suggestions please
